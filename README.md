# Rhymepong

A small multiplayer browser game about rhyming words. 

The connection is peer-to-peer through WebRTC, and uses a small NodeJS server for the WebRTC signaling and for keeping track of the named rooms.

Playable at https://kekelp.itch.io/rhymepong.

Note: the signaling server is hosted on a free tier server and can take up to 5-10 seconds to wake up after inactivity.
